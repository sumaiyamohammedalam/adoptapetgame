# adoptapetgame
This is a game project for my Portfolio Project for Codecademy. 

A text-based terminal game built in Python where you can adopt pets, feed them, play with them, and keep them happy.

This project was created as part of CS101: Introduction to Programming portfolio. It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, including classes, objects, methods, attributes, and interactions between objects.

## Features:
- Adopt a pet by giving it a name and species (dog, cat, rabbit, etc)
- Feed your pets to lower hunger and boost happiness
- Play with your pets to increase happiness (but they get hungrier)
- Check pet moods based on hunger and happiness
- Manage multiple pets under one player
- Interactive menu system using input()
